            Bri is an emerging R&B artist with roots deeply embedded in the heart of Long Island, New York. Born and raised in a close-knit suburban environment, she found her early musical inspiration right at home with her parents and brother. From a tender age, Bri was drawn to the captivating melodies and heartfelt lyrics of R&B classics, a genre that would go on to define her own musical identity. Influenced by contemporary R&B luminaries like H.E.R, SZA, Summer Walker, and Kiana Lede, her music beautifully blends the soulful essence of the old-school R&B she grew up loving with a fresh, modern twist.
